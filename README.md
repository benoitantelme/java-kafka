# java-kafka  
Java code to unit test Kafka messaging framework  

Using a simple producer, consumer, broker and zookeeper.  
Need to check how to bypass the sleep() calls in the test.  
Specific paths to Kafka and Kafka logs in the broker properties:  
* log.dirs=D:/tmp/kafkalogs  
* main.log.dirs=D:/tmp/
